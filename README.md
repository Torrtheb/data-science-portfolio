# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Elizabeth Torrance**, a data science student with a passion for using data to solve real-world problems. I believe data has the power to drive better decisions, uncover hidden patterns, and tell impactful stories. This portfolio showcases a selection of my hands-on projects—ranging from machine learning models to visual analytics—using real-world datasets. Each project reflects my commitment to thoughtful analysis, clear communication, and continuous learning in the field of data science.

## About Me

- I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Python, statistics, and machine learning. 
- Background in mechanical engineering (Masters) and science (Bachelors, majors: physics and chemistry).
- Focused on building explainable models, writing clean code, and elucidating actionable insights.  

## Featured Projects

Here are some projects that I have completed using data available to the public and Kaggle competitions. These projects demonstrate exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, feature engineering, model building and evaluation, and full web deployment (for the Home Credit Default Risk dataset). 

| Project | Description | Key Techniques & Tools |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| 🏠 [Home Credit Default Risk — Streamlit App](./Home_Credit_Default/) | Credit-risk scoring using real loan-application data. Deployed a Streamlit web app so Home Credit employees can search an application ID and instantly see predicted default probability. | Streamlit, LightGBM, feature selection, SHAP interpretability |
| 🚀 [Spaceship Titanic Survival Prediction](./Spaceship_Titanic/) | Kaggle challenge predicting passenger survival on a fictional interstellar voyage. Extensive feature engineering, handling of missing values, and model comparison. | scikit-learn pipeline, hist-gb & LightGBM, cross-validation, SHAP |
| ❤️ [Stroke Prediction](./Stroke_Prediction/) | Binary classifier estimating stroke risk from demographic & lifestyle features. Comparison of logistic regression and balanced random forest models. | Logistic Regression, balanced random forest, class-imbalance handling, ROC-AUC, calibration curve |
| 🧠 [Mental Health in Tech Survey Analysis](./Mental_Health_Survey/) | Exploratory, visualization-driven study of workplace mental-health factors in the tech industry. Highlights storytelling with data. | Pandas, Seaborn & Matplotlib, hypothesis testing |

> 📂 Each folder contains a Jupyter notebook (and/or Python scripts), clean data pipelines, key visuals, and a detailed README.
